## Step 1 - Finding Cheap:
Question: How cheap is a share of this company relative to how much money they bring in?

### P/E Ratio: Price to Earnings.
- Ideally below 15 (you pay $15 for every $1 of earnings)
- Not a perfect metric, because it ignore debt.


### EV/EBIT: Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
- EV = value of all shares + value of all debt - cash (so the value of the entire company)
- EBIT = Operating earnings before financial engineering
- Ideally EV/EBIT is between 5 and 10

## Step 2 - Finding Quality
Question: How much debt does this company have relative to how much equity/earnings they bring in?

### Debt to Equity: Total Debt over Market Cap
- ideally < 0.5

### Debt to EBITDA: How many years of current earnings would it take to pay off all debt
- ideally 2 or below

---

## Step 3 - Finding Efficiency
Question: How much value does a firm generate for every $1 they invest in operations?

### ROIC - Return on Invested Capital = (Net Operating Profit After Tax) / (Invested Capital)
- How much profit (after operating costs and taxes) does the firm make relative to its invested capital?
- Ideally above 10%, but the higher the better!

# Micro Analysis

## Valuation Formulas
- Discounted Cash Flow
- Graham Formula

## Sector Strategies:

### Banking/Finance:
- Key metric: Price to Book Ratio
- Why: Banks are pools of liquid assets, and the book value tells you the net worth of those assets.
- Macro Trigger: Interest rate changes. If interest rates rise, then the gap between what they pay for depostits and what they charge for loans increases (they make more money)

### Energy/Commodities:
- Key Metric: Price to Cash Flow
- Why: Cash flow is the actual cash they brought in, earnings is too inaccurate due to swings in commodity prices
- Macro Trigger: USD strength. Since commodities are priced in USD, a weaker USD pushes prices up.

### Tech/SaaS:
- Key Metric: Rule of 40 (growth rate + profit margin >= 40%)
- Why: This means the firm is funding its own growth
- Macro Trigger: Low interest rates, because it's easier to acquire capital.

### Real Estate (REITs)
- Key Metric: Price to Funds From Ops
- Why: This metric is useful for REITs because their assets generally appreciate rather than depreciate (real estate).
- Macro Trigger: Bond Yields. REITs compete with Bonds for yield-seeking investors, so if Bond yields rise, the price of REITs will lower.

# Macro Variables:

### Yield Curve: 
The difference between short term and long term treasury yields. If fed rates are high, money is harder to borrow, meaning that cash flows are pulled downward.
- Normal Curve: Long term yields are higher than short term yields. (Lenders are less attracted to long term T bills due to interest rate risk, inflation etc)
- Inverted Curve: Short term rates are higher than long term rates (Lenders are attracted to long term T bills because they expect economic recession, future rate cuts, etc)

### Sector Rotation:
Different sectors do well at different parts of the business cycle. In order:
| Cycle Phase | Best Sectors | Reason |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Early Expansion | Financials/Industrials | Banks earn interest on new loans, industrials see orders for new equipment |
| Mid Cycle | Tech/Comms | Growth is stable, companies invest in efficiency (so new tech) |
| Late Cycle | Energy/Materials | Inflation peaks, so commodities hedge against inflation |
| Recession | Utilities/Healthcare | Sectors with stable cashflows that cannot be cut regardless of economic situation |

### Equity Risk Premium:
ERP = Earnings Yield - Risk Free Rate

The extra return you demand for taking the extra risk of holding a stock over a bond.

Earnings Yield = inverse of the P/E ration = 1/P/E

- If ERP is high, stocks are undervalued and you should buy them.
- If ERP is low, then they aren't undervalued and you migh as well own a bond.

### Credit Spreads:
The spread between Junk Bonds and Safe Bonds:
- Narrow: Implies the market is being greedy, people think all debt is safe, the market is irrationally optimistic.
- Widening Spreads: The market is fearful, people may be throwing out value stocks with the bath water.
