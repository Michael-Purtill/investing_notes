## Step 1 - Finding Cheap:
Question: How cheap is a share of this company relative to how much money they bring in?

### P/E Ratio: Price to Earnings.
- Ideally below 15 (you pay $15 for every $1 of earnings)
- Not a perfect metric, because it ignore debt.


### EV/EBIT: Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
- EV = value of all shares + value of all debt - cash (so the value of the entire company)
- EBIT = Operating earnings before financial engineering
- Ideally EV/EBIT is between 5 and 10

## Step 2 - Finding Quality
Question: How much debt does this company have relative to how much equity/earnings they bring in?

### Debt to Equity: Total Debt over Market Cap
- ideally < 0.5

### Debt to EBITDA: How many years of current earnings would it take to pay off all debt
- ideally 2 or below

## Step 3 - Finding Efficiency
Question: How much value does a firm generate for every $1 they invest in operations?

### ROIC - Return on Invested Capital = (Net Operating Profit After Tax) / (Invested Capital)
- How much profit (after operating costs and taxes) does the firm make relative to its invested capital?
- Ideally above 10%, but the higher the better!

# Micro Analysis

## Valuation Formulas

- Discounted Cash Flow
- Graham Formula

## Sector Strategies:

### Banking/Finance:
- Key metric: Price to Book Ratio
- Why: Banks are pools of liquid assets, and the book value tells you the net worth of those assets.
- Macro Trigger: Interest rate changes. If interest rates rise, then the gap between what they pay for depostits and what they charge for loans increases (they make more money)

### Energy/Commodities:
- Key Metric: Price to Cash Flow
- Why: Cash flow is the actual cash they brought in, earnings is too inaccurate due to swings in commodity prices
- Macro Trigger: USD strength. Since commodities are priced in USD, a weaker USD pushes prices up.

### Tech/SaaS:
- Key Metric: Rule of 40 (growth rate + profit margin >= 40%)
- Why: This means the firm is funding its own growth
- Macro Trigger: Low interest rates, because it's easier to acquire capital.

### Real Estate (REITs)
- Key Metric: Price to Funds From Ops
- Why: This metric is useful for REITs because their assets generally appreciate rather than depreciate (real estate).
- Macro Trigger: Bond Yields. REITs compete with Bonds for yield-seeking investors, so if Bond yields rise, the price of REITs will lower.
