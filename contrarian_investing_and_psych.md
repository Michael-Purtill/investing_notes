# Contrarian Investing and Psychology

## Affect
### Affect and the Market
#### Bubbles
Affect may explain bubbles. 
- During the upside of a bubble, people invest at absurd valuations because they saw fortunes being made earlier in the bubble.
- When the bubble pops, people sell too aggressively because they heard of fortunes being lost in the sell off of the bubble. 
In both of these cases, the crowd is not performing a level-headed valuation of the assets in the bubble, either on the upside or the downside.

#### Risk Analysis
Affect affects the risk analysis of humans. Humans view events with higher rewards as being less risky, and they view events with worse punishments as more risky, regardless of the actual probabilities of the events.
